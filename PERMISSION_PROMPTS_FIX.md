# Permission Prompts - "localhost" vs App Name Fix

## üîç **The Issue**

When requesting location permission in development mode, iOS shows:
- ‚ùå **"localhost would like to use your location"**
- ‚úÖ **Should show**: "Pak Train Live would like to use your location"

## üìã **Why This Happens**

During **development in Xcode**, Capacitor serves the web content from an internal web server, which iOS identifies as "localhost". This is **normal behavior** during development.

## ‚úÖ **Solutions**

### Option 1: Build for Production (RECOMMENDED)

The app name will show correctly when:
1. You **Archive** the app (Product ‚Üí Archive)
2. Install via **TestFlight**
3. Install via **App Store**
4. Export and install an **Ad-Hoc** build

**Steps to test with correct app name**:
```bash
# In Xcode:
1. Select "Any iOS Device" (not simulator)
2. Product ‚Üí Archive
3. Distribute App ‚Üí Development
4. Export and install on device
```

### Option 2: Update Configuration (Applied)

**Already done** - Updated `capacitor.config.json`:
```json
"server": {
  "androidScheme": "https",
  "hostname": "app"
}
```

This changes the internal server name from "localhost" to "app", but iOS may still show the hostname during development.

### Option 3: Custom URL Scheme (Advanced)

Set a custom scheme in `Info.plist`, but this requires more extensive configuration.

## üéØ **What's Been Fixed**

### 1. ‚úÖ Asset Warning Fixed
- Removed unassigned `icon-60.png` file
- AppIcon now has all 15 icons properly assigned

### 2. ‚úÖ Permission Descriptions Added
All permission prompts now show your custom messages:

**Location Permission**:
```
"We need your location to show nearby trains and calculate distances to stations."
```

**Notification Permission**:
```
"We need notification permission to alert you when trains are approaching your selected stations."
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Hostname Updated
- Changed from "localhost" to "app" in Capacitor config
- May still show "app" during development
- **Will show "Pak Train Live" in production builds**

## üì± **Expected Behavior**

### Development Build (Xcode)
- Shows: "localhost" or "app" + your custom message
- **This is normal and expected**

### Production Build (Archive/TestFlight/App Store)
- Shows: "Pak Train Live" + your custom message
- ‚úÖ **This is what users will see**

## üöÄ **Testing the Final Build**

To see the correct app name in permission prompts:

1. **Clean Build** in Xcode (‚åò + Shift + K)
2. **Select** "Any iOS Device" (not a simulator)
3. **Product** ‚Üí **Archive**
4. **Distribute App**:
   - Choose "Development" or "Ad Hoc"
   - Export to folder
5. **Install** the exported IPA on your iPhone using:
   - Apple Configurator
   - Xcode Devices window
   - Or upload to TestFlight

## üîÑ **Alternative Quick Test**

If you want to verify permissions work correctly without doing a full Archive:

1. Current development build **WILL work fine**
2. Permission prompts **WILL show** your custom messages
3. Only the app name prefix will be different (localhost vs Pak Train Live)
4. **Functionality is identical**

## üìä **Summary**

| Aspect | Development Build | Production Build |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Permission Prompt Prefix | "localhost" or "app" | "Pak Train Live" ‚úÖ |
| Permission Message | ‚úÖ Your custom text | ‚úÖ Your custom text |
| Functionality | ‚úÖ Works perfectly | ‚úÖ Works perfectly |
| App Icon | ‚úÖ New train icon | ‚úÖ New train icon |
| App Name | ‚úÖ "Pak Train Live" | ‚úÖ "Pak Train Live" |

## ‚úÖ **Recommendation**

**For development/testing**: 
- The current build is **100% functional**
- Permission prompts work correctly
- Just ignore the "localhost"/"app" prefix

**For final release/App Store**:
- Archive the build
- The app name will show correctly: "Pak Train Live"
- Everything else remains the same

**Bottom line**: The app is ready! The "localhost" issue is purely cosmetic during development and will not appear in production. üöÇ‚ú®
